                <li><b>Modernizing Computer Science lab at school</b>			       	<span>May - Present 2023 </span>	</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have always enjoyed coding, so the computer lab was a bit of a haven. However, my friends constantly complained about how outmodeled our equipment was. Some of the keyboards didn’t work, and the machines were running on the archaic Windows 7 software. Finally, our teacher concurred with our desire to upgrade the lab. <br> The school invested in five brand new computers for the students as well as a bunch of new keyboards. <br> When the teacher requested for volunteers to help assemble the computers, I was the first to sign up. <br> Already a hobby, I was glad to be given an opportunity to put together the machines for the computer lab and devoted many hours after school for the same. </li>

    <li><b>Founder - Laptop Donation</b>						<span>September - Present 2023</span></li>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>I scouted for computer rental companies to check whether old parts were available to create more refurbished machines for the lab. I connected with Do-Main services, which supplied laptops in bulk to different software companies. Essentially, when newer models are launched, the old laptops would be returned to Do-Main services and just lie around, waiting to be repurposed. Securing a collaboration with them, I was able to assemble 10-12 machines and donate them to our school computer lab—an endeavor that breathed new life into our resources. </li>
                    <li>I wish to further expand these operations to help other schools improve their computer labs through donations of unused machines from Corporates </li>
                    <li>Crowdfunding?</li>
