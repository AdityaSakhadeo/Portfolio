        <ul>
            <li><b>Head, RepairX</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>To get an electronic device repaired in India, options are generally limited. After hours of research and consulting industry experts on how to balance trust and cost, I decided to create RepairXâ€”a platform that connects customers with trained technicians at reasonable costs. </li>
                <li>To create a pool of talent, I formally trained teenagers and young adults in hardware and software repair skills via a specially designed certification course. It will be offered free of cost and made accessible to anyone who wants to learn.</li>
            </ul>

<li><b>Volunteer Hill Conservation, Vasundhara Abhiyan, (<a href="https://vasundharaabhiyan.org/" target="_blank">https://vasundharaabhiyan.org/</a>)  Pune, India</b>  <span>Sep 2013 - Present</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Every Sunday morning for 4 hours, I contribute to conserving a hill near our residence.  </li>
                <li>This engagement involves practices such as mulching, tree plantation drives, and building shallow cavities in the ground for water harvesting. </li>
                <li>Over a ten-year period, we were able to significantly alter the slope, increasing the number of trees from 150 to 30,000! Our collective efforts have significantly improved biodiversity and restored the delicate ecological balance in the area.</li>

        <p><b> Princeton University, Pre-College and Summer Undergraduate Programs </b> <span> July - Aug 2023</span>  </p>                           
        <ul>
            <li><b>Summer Program in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Thinking (PACT) Group 1 </b></li> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Taught by Prof. Rajiv Gandhi of Rutgers-Camden and University of Pennsylvania</li>
                <li>Studied topics in discrete mathematics such as systematic counting and methods of proof. Learned proof techniques, such as induction, and basic graph theory to prove various theorems.</li>
                <li>Although I was exposed to probability in school, the program introduced me to more theoretical and fundamental topics, developing sophisticated ideas from basic principles. Topics covered in these lectures advanced in difficulty as I learned set theory, advanced permutations and combinations, conditional probability, independent events, random variables, and linearity of expectation. </li>
                <li>Additionally, there were guest lecturers related to other fields of computer science including computational geometry, cryptography, the probabilistic method, and planar graph coloring.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Worked on the resume submission portal for the Fellowship Applications.</li>
                    <li>Initially, I worked with the technical team when I was in Michigan and then worked remotely after returning back to India. Working across timezones was challenging.</li>
                    <li>The project involved understanding requirements, designing the UI and implementing the project.</li>
                    <li>Implemented portal using the Django framework. </li>
